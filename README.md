## Dashboard Desafio
("Dashboard challenge")

Just a small project to mess around with React, Redux, React DnD (Drag and Drop library), a few public/free apis, Webpack that I made in October of 2017.


### Instalation
- pull down the repo
- yarn/npm install
- yarn dev or npm run dev
- open up browser to localhost (default port is 3000)


### APIs used:
- weather
- currency converter
- stock price


### TODOs: 
- write tests
- use flow
- upgrade to webpack 4
- more css/responsiveness


### Quick Demo:
![]()
